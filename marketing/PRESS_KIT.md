**FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE**

**Forma Launches AI-Powered "Snap and Track" Calorie Counter for Busy Professionals**

**LOS ANGELES, CA — [Launch Date]** — Today marks the official launch of **Forma**, a revolutionary nutrition app that leverages advanced AI vision technology to automate the tedious task of calorie tracking. Designed for time-pressed professionals, Forma allows users to log an entire meal’s nutritional data in under 2 seconds simply by taking a photo.

"The biggest barrier to healthy eating isn't a lack of information; it's the friction of manual data entry," says **Ray Zhao**, Founder of Forma. "Most people give up on tracking within the first week because it feels like a part-time job according to current market studies. With Forma, we've replaced the database search and manual weighing with a single snapshot."

Forma’s proprietary AI engine identifies hundreds of different food types and estimates portion sizes with remarkable accuracy, syncing directly with Apple Health and Google Fit to provide a unified view of health.

**Pricing and Availability:**
Forma is available now for download on the **iOS App Store** and **Google Play Store**. The app offers a free tier with 5 scans per day, with a Premium subscription available at $9.99/month or $59.99/year.
