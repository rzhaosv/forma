### Re-engagement Email (30 days inactive)

**Subject:** We miss you (and your progress misses you too)

**Body:**

Hey [Name],

It's been about a month since you logged a meal in Forma.

No judgment—life gets crazy. We get it.

But here's the thing: **the hardest part isn't starting. It's coming back after you've stopped.**

And you're here, reading this email. That means part of you still wants this.

So here's your invitation to start again:

**Just track one meal today.**

That's it. Not a full day. Not a perfect week. Just one meal.

Open Forma, snap a photo of your next meal, and start a new streak.

Remember why you downloaded the app in the first place. That goal is still there, waiting for you.

[Open Forma & Track One Meal →]

You've got this. We believe in you.

Ray & The Forma Team

P.S. - If there's something about the app that frustrated you and made you stop, reply and tell me. I read every email, and your feedback helps make Forma better.

- Don't be overly technical about AI/ML
- Don't compare to competitors by name
- Don't pressure users to upgrade constantly

### Tone Examples

## 🏆 Conversion Optimization Tips

### Paywall Best Practices

1. **Show the paywall early** - Day 1 or after first scan limit
2. **Use free trial** - 7 days removes purchase friction
3. **Highlight annual savings** - "$60/year savings!" is powerful
4. **Add urgency** - "Trial expires in 6:23:45"
5. **Social proof** - "10,000+ premium users"
6. **Money-back guarantee** - Removes risk
7. **One-tap restore** - For previous subscribers

### Copy Optimization Principles

1. **Benefits > Features** - "Track faster" not "AI-powered scanning"
2. **Concrete > Abstract** - "10x faster" not "much faster"
3. **Social Proof** - Numbers, testimonials, ratings
4. **Objection Handling** - Address "too expensive," "don't need it," "not sure"
5. **Scarcity** - "Trial ends soon" (but be honest)
6. **Urgency** - "Start today" (but don't be pushy)
7. **Clarity** - Short sentences, simple words

### Subscription Pricing Psychology

1. **Annual Discounts** - 50% off shows huge value
2. **Monthly Price on Annual** - "$5/mo" instead of "$59.99/year"
3. **Price Anchoring** - Compare to nutrition coaching ($200/mo)
4. **Free Trial** - Lowers barrier, increases conversions
5. **Default to Annual** - Pre-select best value option
6. **Show Savings** - "Save $60" in big text
